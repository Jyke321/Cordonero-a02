        Exercise 12 - Computing Simple Interest
    Computing simple interest is a great way to quickly figure out whether an investment has value.
    Itâ€™s also a good way to get comfortable with explicitly coding the order of operations in your programs.
    Create a program that computes simple interest.
    Prompt for the principal amount, the rate as a percentage, and the time, and
    display the amount accrued (principal + interest).
    The formula for simple interest is A = P(1 + rt),
    where P is the principal amount, r is the annual rate of interest,
    t is the number of years the amount is invested, and A is the amount at the end of the investment.

        Example Output
    Enter the principal: 1500
    Enter the rate of interest: 4.3
    Enter the number of years: 4
    After 4 years at 4.3%, the investment will be worth $1758.
        Constraints
    ~Prompt for the rate as a percentage (like 15, not .15). Divide the input by 100 in your program.
    ~Ensure that fractions of a cent are rounded up to the next penny.
    ~Ensure that the output is formatted as money.
